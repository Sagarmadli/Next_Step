The NEXT STEP discusses the importance of providing secondary-level students (grades 9 to 12) with comprehensive information about career choices to enable them to make informed decisions about their studies. 
It highlights the various types of information that students need, including the relationship between subjects and career paths, Higher Educational Institutions, entrance exams, and aptitude tests. 
Overall, this emphasizes the importance of providing students with the tools and resources they need to make informed decisions about their future careers.   
It also notes that students may benefit from access to a counselor through the website, to discuss their concerns and questions about their career choices.
